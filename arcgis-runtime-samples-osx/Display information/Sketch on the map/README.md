##How it works

To set the type of geometry, you need to assign the `geometryBuilder` property on `AGSSketchGraphicsOverlay`. It could be a `AGSPointBuilder` or `AGSPolylineBuilder` or `AGSPolygonBuilder`. The sketch graphics overlay has a undo manager of type `NSUndoManager` that provides the undo and redo methods. To clear everything there is a `clear` method on the sketch graphics overlay.
